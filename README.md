# E-Commerce ASP.NET WebForms Application
Developed using ASP.NET WebForms, this application simulates a small e-commerce platform.
It features a product display page with photos, detail views for each item including descriptions and add-to-cart options, and a shopping cart page where users can manage their selections.
Designed without a database, the site relies on static classes for data management, making it an efficient project to demonstrate dynamic web development with ASP.NET, Bootstrap, and CSS.
